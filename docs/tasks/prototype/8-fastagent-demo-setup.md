## Description
Configure FastAgent demo client with MCP sampling integration for testing security evaluation scenarios

## Details
Configure FastAgent demo client to test sampling functionality for Superego MCP Server.

Technical Requirements:
- FastAgent client configured to connect to Superego MCP server
- Demo scenarios showcasing security evaluation
- Test cases for allowed, denied, and sampled operations
- Integration testing with actual sampling calls

⚠️ CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT:
The implementation team MUST read the latest FastAgent documentation on GitHub to understand:
- MCP sampling request/response protocol  
- FastAgent configuration with server references
- Agent definitions and interactive mode setup
- Proper demo scenario implementation

FastAgent Configuration:
```yaml
# demo/fastagent.config.yaml  
mcp:
  servers:
    superego:
      transport: "stdio"  
      command: "uv"
      args: ["run", "python", "-m", "superego_mcp.main"]
      cwd: "../"
      sampling:
        enabled: true
        model: "claude-3-sonnet"
        timeout: 30
```

Demo Agent Implementation:
```python
# demo/security_demo_agent.py
import fast_agent as fast
import asyncio

@fast.agent(
    name="security_demo",
    instruction="""You are a security demo agent testing the Superego MCP server.
    
Your job is to demonstrate security evaluation by attempting various tool operations:
1. Safe operations that should be allowed
2. Dangerous operations that should be denied  
3. Complex operations that require AI sampling evaluation

Always explain what you're testing and what result you expect.""",
    servers=["superego"]
)
async def main():
    """Demo agent showcasing security evaluation"""
    
    print("🛡️ Superego Security Demo Agent")
    print("This agent will test various tool operations through the security layer.")
    print("Watch how different requests are allowed, denied, or sampled.\n")
    
    async with fast.run() as agent:
        # Run interactive mode for manual testing
        await agent.interactive()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Automated Demo Scenarios:
```python
# demo/automated_demo.py
import fast_agent as fast

Demo Justfile Tasks:
```make
# Add to justfile
demo:
    @echo "🚀 Starting FastAgent Security Demo"
    cd demo && uv run python security_demo_agent.py

demo-auto:
    @echo "🧪 Running Automated Security Scenarios" 
    cd demo && uv run python automated_demo.py

demo-setup:
    @echo "📦 Setting up FastAgent demo environment"
    uv add --optional-group demo fast-agent-mcp
    cd demo && uv run fast-agent init
```

Implementation Steps:
1. Create demo/ directory with FastAgent configuration
2. Read FastAgent documentation for proper MCP sampling setup
3. Implement security demo agent with interactive mode
4. Create automated demo scenarios for testing
5. Add justfile tasks for easy demo execution
6. Test end-to-end functionality with actual MCP server
EOF < /dev/null

## Validation
- [ ] FastAgent connects successfully to Superego MCP server
- [ ] Demo agent can invoke evaluate_tool_request through MCP sampling
- [ ] Safe operations return "allow" decisions
- [ ] Dangerous operations return "deny" decisions  
- [ ] Complex operations trigger AI sampling (if implemented)
- [ ] Automated scenarios demonstrate expected security behavior
- [ ] Tests: FastAgent connection, demo scenario execution, MCP integration

Test scenarios:
1. FastAgent connects to MCP server via STDIO transport
2. Demo agent runs in interactive mode successfully
3. Safe commands (ls, read, grep) are allowed
4. Dangerous commands (rm, sudo, chmod) are denied
5. Complex commands (edit, write, delete) trigger appropriate evaluation
6. Automated demo scenarios run and report results
7. End-to-end integration works correctly
